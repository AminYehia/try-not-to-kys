Try Not To KYS is a game where you control a wizard that has crippling depression that prevents him form walking.
The wizard can spawn fireballs and control these balls to defeate evil shadows that are crawling towards him.
> (Shadows are still under development)
It is note worthy to mention that your own fireballs can kill you.

The current state of the game is that you can only spawn fireballs with "Space" and move them around with "Arrow Keys".

This game is not finished, not sure if it can be called a game or if it will ever be finished. It is a fun side project to me.
The "game" is available for download for windows at https://github.com/AminYehia/try-not-to-kys/releases.
