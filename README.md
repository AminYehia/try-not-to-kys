Try Not To KYS is a game where you control a wizard that has crippling depression that prevents him form walking.
The wizard can shoot fireballs to kill ghosts approaching him.
After a certain amount of time the wizard's evil wand will change its behaviour and reverse the shooting spell and the self-killing spell.
Help the wizard defend himself against ghosts and try not to make him kill himself.

Controls are "Z" and "X" to either shoot a fireball or kys, and "Arrow Keys" to control directions.
